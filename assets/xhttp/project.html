  <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-blue-gray">
    I developed the original <i>terrestrial</i> system in the early nineties in MS Access. 
    It was for a construction company to help run Local Authority Voids and Emergency Repair contracts. 
    It essentially allows for a job to be logged, operatives assigned and progress tracked.
    It worked well, so with the advent of the internet I created the first online version.
  </div>

  <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-blue-gray">
    On a different contract, I learnt all about the insurance industry's
    Repair and Refurbishment business. 
    My system was well suited and Claimtrack was born.
  </div>

  <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-blue-gray">
   Part of my vision of the web version was that, for the first time, we could allow tenants limited access.
   They could commicate with both the office and the operative assigned to the job, via the app.
  </div>


  <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-blue-gray">
    However, this vision was not shared. Tenant access was rarely allowed. Really it had just added to
    the landlord's armoury, as usual putting the tenant on the back foot.
  </div>


  <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-blue-gray">
    <i>So, how do I turn the tables?</i><br />
    At the heart of <i>Claimtrack</i> are <i>access keys</i>.
    These keys allow access and sets level of access.
    <br />
    In <i>Claimtrack</i> keys are issued by the <i>landlord</i>.
    <br />
    In <i>Letcomm</i> the <i>tenant</i> issues the key.
  </div>

  <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-blue-gray">
    <i>How do I pursuade landlords to use?</i>
    <br />
    It is essential that I build a really good tool for landlords.
    There are thousands of landlords in the UK with small portfolios, that have no online system and would welcome Letcomm.
  </div>


  <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-blue-gray">
    <i>What if they won't play ball?</i>
    <br />
    A lot of larger landlords have these systems and may well not participate.
    I'm getting aheaad of myself, but if I can get the support from the agencies, Letcomm could become a credible and accepted platform.
  </div>

  
  <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-blue-gray">
    <i>Letcomm has stand-alone value</i>
    <br />
    If the landlord refuses to acknowledge Letcomm, when a situation occurs, the tenant records all information, photos etc.
    This is date and time stamped, by the system and cannot be changed.
    This info is emailed to the landlord, along with a link to the Letcomm site displaying same details, allowing response.
  </div>


  <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-blue-gray">
    The landlord can still ignore, but the tenant has proof that a detailed communication was made.
    <br />
    At the end of the day; 
    <br />
    <i>'Good landlords will love it, bad landlords will hate it'</i>.
  </div>
