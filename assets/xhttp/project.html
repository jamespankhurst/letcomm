    I developed the original terrestrial system in the early nineties in MS Access. 
    It was for a construction company to help run Local Authority Voids and Emergency Repair contracts. 
    It essentially allows for a job to be logged, operatives assigned and progress tracked.
    It worked well, so with the advent of the internet I created the first online version.
  </div>

  <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-amber">
    Things took a turn when, on a different contract, I learnt all about the insurance industry's
    Repair and Refurbishment business. My system was perfect and Claimtrack was born.
  </div>

  <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-amber">
   Part of my vision of the web version was that, for the first time, we could allow tenants limited access.
   They could commicate with both the office and the operative assigned to the job via the app.
  </div>


  <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-amber">
    However, this vision was not shared. Tenant access was never allowed. Really it had just added to
    the landlord's armoury, as usual putting the tenant on the back foot.
  </div>


  <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-amber">
    <i>So, how do I turn the tables?</i><br />
    At the heart of the system are <i>access keys</i>.
    These keys allow access and set level of access and <i>until now</i> are issued by the landlord.
    With Letcomm the tenant issues the key.
  </div>

  <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-amber">
    <i>How do I pursuade landlords to use?</i>
    <br />
    It is essential that I build a really good tool for landlords.
    There are thousands of landlords in the UK with small portfolios, that have no online system and would welcome Letcomm.
  </div>


  <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-amber">
    <i>What if they refuse?</i>
    <br />
    A lot of larger landlords have these systems and may well not participate.
    However, Letcomm still has value stand-alone.
    When a situation occurs, the tenant records all information, photos etc which is date and time stamped, by the system and cannot be changed.
    This info is emailed to the landlord, along with a link to the letcomm site displaying same details.

  </div>


  <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-amber">
    The landlord can still ignore, but the tenant has proof.

    At the end of the day 
    <br />
    <i>'Good landlords will love it, bad landlords will hate it'</i>.
  </div>
