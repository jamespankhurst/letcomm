    Claimtrack was originally developed with Classic  ASP and vbScript. 
    As the user base grew it was obvious it was becoming too slow. 
    It was necessary to convert to .NET, which produced Trackpro. 
    Running compiled code with fast data access made the difference.

    Letcomm is being developed using my Apache web server, I do not have web server access to IIS.
    I am developing the system in Php, mySql, but utilising JavaScript Objects / JSON to a much greater extent, hopefully 
    making update speeds less critical.

  <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-amber">
    The existing system makes frequent requests to the server. With Letcomm I hold data locally
    utilising js objects, and storage API's, with the user 'pushing' to the server.

    It may well be the case that in the future it will be necessary to commute to a .NET environment.
    I will bear this in mind at all times.
