    Claimtrack was originally developed with Classic  ASP and vbScript. 
    As the user base grew it was obvious it was becoming too slow. 
    It was necessary to convert to .NET, which produced Trackpro. 
    Running compiled code with fast data access made the difference.

    Whilst I can develop locally in .NET, I cuurently do not have access to an online IIS web server.
    I'm developing Letcomm on my Apache web server, using Php/mySql, but utilising JavaScript Objects / JSON to a much greater extent. 
    Hopefully this will make update less frequent.

  <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-blue-gray">
    Claimtrack makes frequent requests to the server. With Letcomm I hold data locally
    utilising js objects, and storage API's, with the user 'pushing' to the server.

  <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-border-blue-gray">
    It may well be the case that in the future it will be necessary to commute to a .NET environment.
    I will bear this in mind at all times.
