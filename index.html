     In the late ninties, I was involved in developing insurance claim software, with particular reference to property maintenance.
     <br />
     It gave the landlord/property management company control of daily issues; roof leaks, gutters blocked, broken windows, etc.
     <br />
     The system issued 'access keys' to third parties; roofers, builders, surveyors....but NEVER tenants.
     <br />
     In the early 2000's I developed the first web version of this software in vbScript, classic ASP:
      <br />
     No Longer active(claimtrack.co.uk)
<br />
     I then re-wrote in vb.NET, ASP.NET and is the current version:
<br />
     http://www.trackpro.co.uk
<br />
     I am now a tenant, and this worm has turned!
<br />
     The communication with my Property Managemnt Company is APALLING.
<br />
     I report problems...nothing happens.
     <br />
     I chase up, they deny any knowledge
     <br />
     I report the problem again...nothing happens.
<br />
     And the merry-go-round continues.... 
<br />
     ...trouble is I KNOW the information is at their fingertips.
     <br />
     I've decided to re-write my software again, but this time for the TENANT.
