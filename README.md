In the pre-internet ninties, I was involved in developing insurance claim software, with particular reference to property maintenance.

I developed the first web version of this software in classic ASP, claimtrack.co.uk, then re-coded for .NET to produce the current version trackpro.co.uk.

The system works by issuing 'access keys' (my nineties version of a ssh - without secure) to third parties; roofers, builders, surveyors....and tenants.

Even though the system was now internet based and the landlords/property management companies (PMCs) had the ability to allow tenant access, they rarely, if ever, did. 

I am now a tenant.

The communication with my Property Managemnt Company is APALLING.

I report problems...nothing happens. 
I chase up, they deny any knowledge
I report the problem again...nothing happens. 

And the merry-go-round continues, trouble is I KNOW the information is at their fingertips.

I've decided to re-write my software again, but this time for the TENANT.

This time the tenant will issue the 'access keys'....
