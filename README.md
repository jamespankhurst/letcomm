Times have changed. 

Property ownership in the UK is becoming a distant hope, rather than an expectation.

For many nowadays, and for future generations renting is for life.

The current rights and controls for the tenant are outrageous, and HAVE to completely overhauled. (What happened to Section 21 removal as promised Mr B J).

In the pre-internet ninties, I was involved in developing insurance claim software, with particular reference to property maintenance.

I developed the first web version of this software in classic ASP, claimtrack.co.uk, then re-coded for .NET to produce the current version trackpro.co.uk.

The system works by issuing 'access keys' (my nineties version of a ssh - without secure) to third parties; roofers, builders, surveyors....and tenants.

Even though the system was now internet based and the landlords/property management companies (PMCs) had the ability to allow tenant access, they rarely, if ever, did. 

I am now a tenant.

The communication with my Property Managemnt Company is APALLING.

I report problems...nothing happens. 
I chase up, they deny any knowledge
I report the problem again...nothing happens. 

And the merry-go-round continues, trouble is I KNOW the information is at their fingertips.

I've decided to re-write my software again, but this time for the TENANT.

This time the tenant will issue the 'access keys'....
