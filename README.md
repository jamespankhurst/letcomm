In the late ninties, I was involved in developing insurance claim software, with particular reference to property maintenance.

It gave the landlord/property management company control of daily issues; roof leaks, gutters blocked, broken windows, etc.

The system issued 'access keys' to third parties; roofers, builders, surveyors....but NEVER tenants.

In the early 2000's I developed the first web version of this software in vbScript, classic ASP: 

No Longer active(claimtrack.co.uk) 

I then re-wrote in vb.NET, ASP.NET and is the current version:

http://www.trackpro.co.uk

I am now a tenant, and this worm has turned!

The communication with my Property Managemnt Company is APALLING.

I report problems...nothing happens. 
I chase up, they deny any knowledge
I report the problem again...nothing happens. 

And the merry-go-round continues, trouble is I KNOW the information is at their fingertips.

I've decided to re-write my software again, but this time for the TENANT.
